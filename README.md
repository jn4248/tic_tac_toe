# tic_tac_toe
Simple Tic Tac Toe game, using ruby (non GUI)

The game can be played either as single-player, against the computer, or as 2-player.  Constructing the TicTacToe object using two name parameters initiates a 2-person game, while passing only one name will begin a single-player game.

The game is played via the console/terminal interface.  There is no GUI interface at this point.  

For simplicity, the computer does not intelligently choose its squares.  It merely chooses a square at random among the remaining choices.  

The game results in either player winning, or a tie.
